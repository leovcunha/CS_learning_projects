 * definitions:
 * 
 * Ukkonen rules according to : 
 * 
 * Rule 1---
 * After an insertion from root,
 * active_noderemains root
 * active_edge말s set to the first character of the new suffix we need to insert, i.e.막
 * active_length말s reduced by 1
 * 
 * Rule 2:--
 * If we split an edge and insert a new node, and if that is맕ot the first node created during the current step, 
 * we connect the previously inserted node and the new node through a special pointer, a맙uffix link. We will 
 * later see why that is useful. Here is what we get, the suffix link is represented as a dotted edge:
 * 
 * Rule 3:
 * After splitting an edge from an active_node맚hat is not the root node, we follow the suffix link going out of 
 * that node, if there is any, and reset theactive_node맚o the node it points to. If there is no suffix link, 
 * we set theactive_node맚o the root.마ctive_edgeand마ctive_lengthremain unchanged.
