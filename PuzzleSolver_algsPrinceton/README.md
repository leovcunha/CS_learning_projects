####I. Objective
Write a program to solve word searching puzzles, where words from a dictionary are to be found in a two-dimensional array of letters. For example, you might be given the following array:
                     m v j l i x a p e
                     j h b x e e n p p
                     h k t t h b s w y
                     r w a i n u y z h
                     p p f x r d z k q
                     t p n l q o y j y
                     a n h a p f g b g
                     h x m s h w y l y
                     u j f j h r s o a

Your program is to find words from the dictionary that can be spelled out in the puzzle by starting at any character, then moving in a straight line up, down, left, right, or on any of the four diagonals. For example, the above array contains the word algorithm because it can be spelled out by starting the lower right corner and moving up and to the left; and it contains the word syzygy because it can be spelled out by starting at the s on the third row and moving down.
